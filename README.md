# 6502 SystemC CPU Simulation

This project is for educational purposes (primarily my own education) and
implements a cycle-accurate simulation of the MOS 6502 CPU using C++ and
SystemC. It models instruction execution and memory transactions with timing
that reflects the original hardware.

## Features

- Cycle-accurate execution
- Modular opcode and addressing mode handling
- Per-instruction cycle logging

## Next Steps

- Complete the instruction set
- Run 6502 ROMS
- Allow connecting peripherals
